# DATA101-FIES2018-DSWD

● Application name: FIES 2018 Visualization Map

● Link to the deployed application: https://fies2018-dswd.herokuapp.com/

● Short description:
This web application visualizes the data retrieved from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey of 2018 (FIES 2018) which shows the different income streams and different items that households are spending money on. It has over 140,000 data samples from all 17 regions of the Philippines. This application utilizes its data to show the difference in income and spending between the different regions and provinces through a map and different graphs. Our target users is mainly DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) since they are tasked in providing assistance to areas that are in need. Especially during these times, it is important to identify areas that require more assitance than some other sectors. Through this web application, we would be able to help DSWD visualize the different areas that require assitance with specific needs. Some areas show high spending in food while others show low spending in food. We would like to be able to help our benefactors, the less privileged families, by being able to direct the proper authorities in order to provide thenm  with proper assitance.
